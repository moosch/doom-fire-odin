# Doom Fire

Playing with fire...in Odin.

Creating the fire animation from Doom. It's a classic.

Written in Odin using the SDL2 library.

Taken from [this post](https://fabiensanglard.net/doom_fire_psx/index.html) as a nice kata to practice.

## Get it running

You'll need the [Odin compiler](https://odin-lang.org/docs/install/) (I'm using `dev-2024-03-nightly:4c35633e0` version).

Then simply run `odin run .` and you should be seeing ðŸ”¥
